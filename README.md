# Tix — Your All-in-One Ticketing App

Welcome to Tix! This is a Vue 3 project built for the HNG Internship. It’s a ticket booking and support app that lets users sign up, log in, manage tickets, and view stats — all in a clean, responsive interface.

This README explains what the app does, how it works, and how it meets the HNG requirements. It also includes a breakdown of the mock API logic and how to inspect stored user data in your browser Network.

## 🧠 How Authentication Works (Mock API)

This app uses a mock authentication system — no real backend, just `localStorage`.

### 📝 Login
{
  email: 'user@example.com',
  password: 'password123'
}

### 🔐 Signup

When a user signs up, their info is saved to `localStorage` like this:

```js
{
  fullName: "Chux",
  email: "chux@example.com",
  password: "secret123"
}
